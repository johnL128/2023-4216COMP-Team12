When the program is run, the user is greeted with a menu in which they will be given a select number of choices to choose from.
To access each individual visualisation, the user will need to select a number to execute any of the desired visualisations provided by the authors within this project.

Each visualisation is listed in chronological order, according to the menu provided in the program (1-6):

When the user accesses my section of the program, a number of questions will be asked in order to filter according to the requirements of the user. This will begin with asking the country code, then asking for a custom beginning and end year in order to take the neccessary data needed to plot. The program will then ask for a type of visualisation whether it will be seperate graphs showing urban and rural individually, or a comparison graph.The terminal will then print a statement providing the user with the data they requested for alongside the visualisation(s).
